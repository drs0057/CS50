Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With only 10 simulations, Portugal was ranked highest. As the amounf of simulations increased, Belgium was shown to be the best team.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After increasing the simulations to 1000, it is clear Belgium is the top choice. For increased reliability of predictions with minimal extra computing power, 10000 simulations is more than enough.
